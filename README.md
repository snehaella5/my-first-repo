# my-first-repo
Welcome to my very first Git and VS Code project! This repository marks the beginning of my journey into software development, version control, and collaborative coding.

##  Inside Details:

Here’s what I’ve built so far:

 GradeMaster
> A student grade management system that stores and retrieves student marks from a CSV file.

- Add student names and grades (Math, Science, English)
- Search for students by name
- Calculate class average
- Data saved in `student.csv`

 Path: `gradmaester/gradmaster.py`

---

###  Digital Clock
> A live clock GUI that updates every second using `tkinter`.

Path: `mini project/digital clock/digital_clock.py`

---

###  LexiFix – Spell Checker
> Type something with mistakes and let Python fix it using TextBlob.  
*LexiFix* is a fancy name for my spell checker 

 Path: `mini project/lexiFix.py`

---

###  Text Editor App
> A simple notepad built with `tkinter`. You can type, save, open `.txt` files — just like a tiny Notepad.

 Path: `mini project/text editor app.py`

---

###  Tic-Tac-Toe Game
> Classic 2-player terminal game (X vs O) built in Python.

 Path: `mini project/tic-tactoe-game.py`

---

###  To-Do App
> Basic to-do list where you can add and delete tasks using a GUI.

 Path: `mini project/todo app.py`

---

###  Rent Calculator
> Split the total rent equally between roommates.

 Path: `project.py/rentcalculator.py`

---

###  Cafe Management System
> Simple terminal-based menu for ordering food, calculating total cost, and displaying the bill.

 Path: `project.py/cafe_mgt.py`

---

##  What I’m Learning

- Python basics (input/output, loops, functions)
- `tkinter` for GUI development
- File handling (read/write CSV and TXT files)
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Organizing code in folders like a pro

---

##  Requirements

You only need Python installed.

If you're using the spell checker (`lexiFix.py`), you'll also need:

```bash
pip install textblob
